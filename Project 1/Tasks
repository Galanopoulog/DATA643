Goal of Project 1:

Find/Build a dataset (minimum requirement, at least five users, across at least five items, with some missing data).
Encouraged to create a small, relatively dense “user-item” matrix as a subset.
-- Dataset source: http://nifty.stanford.edu/2011/craig-book-recommendations/
-- Ratings dataset: http://nifty.stanford.edu/2011/craig-book-recommendations/ratings.txt
-- Titles dataset: http://nifty.stanford.edu/2011/craig-book-recommendations/books.txt

Load data and create a user-item matrix.

Break ratings into separate training and test datasets.

Using training data, calculate the raw average (mean) rating for every user-item combination.

Calculate the RMSE for raw average for both training data and test data.

Using training data, calculate the bias for each user and each item.

From the raw average, and the appropriate user and item biases, calculate the baseline predictors for every user-item combination.

Calculate the RMSE for the baseline predictors for both training data and test data.

Summarize results.
