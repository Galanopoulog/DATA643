Final Project Goal:
Build a recommender system using a large dataset (ex: 1M+ ratings or 10k+ users, 10k+ items)


Three deliverables:

[1] Planning Document
Find an interesting dataset and describe the system you plan to build out.
If you would like to use one of the datasets you have already worked with, you should add a unique element or incorporate additional data.
(i.e. explicit features you scrape from another source, like image analysis on movie posters).
The overall goal, however, will be to produce quality recommendations by extracting insights from a large dataset.
You may do so using Spark, or another distributed computing method, OR by effectively applying one of the more advanced mathematical
techniques we have covered. There is no preference for one over the other, as long as your recommender works!

[2] Presentation
Make a five-minute presentation of your system.
You should use this project to showcase some of the concepts that you have learned in this course, while delivering on the (probably) 
less familiar Spark platform. You are welcome to submit a compelling alternative proposal (subject to approval), such as implementing 
a recommender system using in Microsoft Azure ML Studio or with Google TensorFlow, or building out an application of 
a certain complexity using another tool.

[3] Implementation
In this final project deliverable, youâ€™ll build out the system that you describe in your planning document.
