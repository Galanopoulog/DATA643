-Adapt a recommendation system to work with Apache Spark and compare the performance with previous iterations.

-Consider the efficiency of the system and the added complexity of using Spark.

-May use PySpark (Python), SparkR (R) , sparklyr (R), or Scala.

-Also, consider:
  For your given recommender systemâ€™s data, algorithm(s), and (envisioned) implementation, at what point would
  you see moving to a distributed platform such as Spark becoming necessary?
